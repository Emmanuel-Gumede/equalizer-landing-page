## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learnt a lot about responsive design using a mobile-first aproach. I also learnt drawing a variety of shapes and positioning them on the page using css only.

### Continued development

Going forward, I will be focusing more on writing css styles using SCSS syntax, especially reusable functions.
